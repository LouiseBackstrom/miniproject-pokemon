# Poképedia

This is a web app where you can find all your favourite pokémons divided into color categories! 
In the navbar you will find all the colors to choose between 
and while in a specific category you can click on a pokémon card to get all the necessary info about that pokémon. If you like some pokémons more than others, you can favourise your pokémons just by clicking on the pokémon ball on your favourite card.

Go to your favourites by clicking on the pokémon ball in the navbar. There you will find a list of your favourite cards.

On top of this you will also be greeted with a "Pokémon of the day" on the start page. By clicking on the Pokémon of the day you will get info about it. This means you will discover a new pokémon every day!  
Go ahead and loose yourself in our Poképedia app.
